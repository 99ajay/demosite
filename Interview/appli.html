                      Dear Sir/Mam,
                      
                      Most respectfully, I beg to state that I am suffering from fever since yesterday. Therefore, I am unable to attend the school.
                      Kindly grant me leave for two days, from 5th June to 10th June.
                      
                      Thanking you.
                      Yours Sincerely,
                      vinod thapa
